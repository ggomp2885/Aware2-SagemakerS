# Aware-SagemakerS-ML


#Purpose of the project:
I believe that we can use biofeedback to enhance the emotions and overall wellbeing of a large portion of the population. I believe that raising our collective consciousness of our emotions will allow everyone to communicate better, and therefore work better together, and will lead to us easily solving many of the pressing issues of our times. At the core of all this, I believe that when we feel good, we do good.


##So how do we do this?:
1. I think training the body's reflexes with relaxation therapy, using biofeedback, is an inexpenbly effective way to bring a higher emotional state to the most people.

2. I also think, in addition to relaxation therapy practice, gains can also be made with a more, long term approach which records a users biosignals over a period of months, and correlates gains in wellbeing with specific actions, and how they change over time.




Whats the 1 sentence breakdown of the code I am using to do this?
I will take my own personal data from the past 90 days, I will do some initial data exploration, and then I will feed the best features into a Time Series model -DeepAR - using Sagemaker. With this model I will be able to see a few things

Meaningful Exploratory Analysis
A. Trends over time


Meaningful Machine Learning Conclusions
A. Predictions for future days
C. Supervised classification for classifying timeframes into categories
D. Unsupervised clustering for new categories


I have constructed a way to integrate daily self measurements, with biofeedback data, to create a more well rounded image of our emotional cycles, based on what were doing at the time. This is already a fully deployable web app that I can host for realtime data predictions if you would like to instantly input your own data.
